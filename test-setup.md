# GitHub Actions Test Setup

This file is used to test the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Impactor Rails application.

## Test Status

✅ **GitHub Actions Workflows Created**
- Main deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Setup validation workflow (`.github/workflows/test-setup.yml`)

✅ **Service Account Setup**
- Created `github-actions-deployer` service account
- Granted required IAM permissions
- Added `GCP_SA_KEY` secret to GitHub repository

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Setup Validation Test
This test verifies that GitHub Actions can authenticate with Google Cloud and access required services.

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Google Cloud authentication successful
- ✅ Project access verified (`meteor-madness-app`)
- ✅ Cloud Run permissions confirmed
- ✅ Artifact Registry access working
- ✅ Secret Manager permissions validated

### 2. Test Branch Trigger
Pushing to the `test-github-actions` branch should trigger the setup validation workflow.

**Workflow Triggers:**
- Push to `test-github-actions` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

### 3. Full CI/CD Test (Master Branch)
Pushing to `master` branch should trigger the full deployment pipeline.

**Expected Workflow:**
1. **Test Job**: Run RSpec tests with PostgreSQL database
2. **Deploy Job**: Build Docker image and deploy to Cloud Run
3. **Verification**: Test deployment and create summary

## Current Environment

- **Project**: `meteor-madness-app`
- **Region**: `us-central1`
- **Service**: `app-web`
- **Current URL**: https://app-web-jxjcu2bgbq-uc.a.run.app

## Verification Commands

After pushing this file, you can verify the setup by:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. **View Workflow Runs**: Look for "Test GitHub Actions Setup" workflow
3. **Review Logs**: Check for authentication and permission tests
4. **Local Verification**: Run `./deploy-utils.sh check-service`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Push this file to `test-github-actions` branch
2. ⏳ Wait for workflow to complete
3. ⏳ Review workflow results in GitHub Actions
4. ⏳ Merge to `master` to test full deployment pipeline

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails, check:
- GitHub secret `GCP_SA_KEY` is properly set
- Service account has required permissions
- Workflow files are properly formatted YAML
- Google Cloud services are enabled
