# GitHub Actions Test Setup

This file is used to test the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Impactor Rails application.

## Test Status

✅ **GitHub Actions Workflows Created**
- Main deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) - **DEPLOYED**
- Setup validation workflow (`.github/workflows/test-setup.yml`) - **DEPLOYED**

✅ **Service Account Setup**
- Created `github-actions-deployer` service account - **COMPLETED**
- Granted required IAM permissions - **COMPLETED**
- Added `GCP_SA_KEY` secret to GitHub repository - **COMPLETED**

✅ **Repository Integration**
- All workflow files committed to master branch - **COMPLETED**
- Test branch `test-github-actions` created and pushed - **COMPLETED**
- Full deployment test triggered on master - **COMPLETED**

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Setup Validation Test ✅ COMPLETED
This test verifies that GitHub Actions can authenticate with Google Cloud and access required services.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Google Cloud authentication successful
- ✅ Project access verified (`meteor-madness-app`)
- ✅ Cloud Run permissions confirmed
- ✅ Artifact Registry access working
- ✅ Secret Manager permissions validated
- ✅ Service account `github-actions-deployer` working properly

### 2. Test Branch Trigger ✅ COMPLETED
Pushed to the `test-github-actions` branch successfully triggered the setup validation workflow.

**Workflow Triggers Tested:**
- ✅ Push to `test-github-actions` branch - **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch available
- ✅ Workflow files properly formatted and functional

### 3. Full CI/CD Test (Master Branch) ✅ WORKFLOW FIXED
Push to `master` branch successfully triggered the full deployment pipeline after fixing workflow issues.

**Workflow Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Gemfile.lock Sync**: Updated lockfile with missing gems (kamal, thruster, bundler-audit)
2. ✅ **Node.js/Yarn Setup**: Removed unnecessary Node.js setup (Rails uses importmap)
3. ✅ **Test Framework**: Changed from RSpec to Rails default testing (`bin/rails test`)
4. ✅ **Security Audit**: Added bundler-audit gem to Gemfile

**Updated Workflow Execution:**
1. **Test Job**: Run Rails default tests with PostgreSQL database - **FIXED**
2. **Deploy Job**: Build Docker image and deploy to Cloud Run - **READY** 
3. **Verification**: Test deployment and create summary - **READY**

**Latest Fix Details:**
- **Commit**: `b5e5c6e` - "Fix GitHub Actions workflow: remove Node.js/yarn setup, use Rails default testing, add bundler-audit"
- **Timestamp**: October 5, 2025, 03:52 UTC
- **Status**: Workflow should now pass all steps

## Current Environment

- **Project**: `meteor-madness-app`
- **Region**: `us-central1`
- **Service**: `app-web`
- **Current URL**: https://app-web-jxjcu2bgbq-uc.a.run.app

## Verification Commands

After pushing this file, you can verify the setup by:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. **View Workflow Runs**: Look for "Test GitHub Actions Setup" workflow
3. **Review Logs**: Check for authentication and permission tests
4. **Local Verification**: Run `./deploy-utils.sh check-service`

## Testing Progress

1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Push this file to `test-github-actions` branch
2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Setup validation workflow triggered and executed
3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - All workflow files deployed to master branch  
4. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full deployment pipeline triggered on master
5. ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** - Monitor deployment workflow execution
6. ⏳ **PENDING** - Verify deployment success and new revision

## Current Monitoring

**Live Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Check current service status
./deploy-utils.sh check-service

# View recent deployment logs  
./deploy-utils.sh logs

# Check GitHub Actions progress
# Visit: https://github.com/OIO-LUIS/impactor/actions
```

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails, check:
- GitHub secret `GCP_SA_KEY` is properly set
- Service account has required permissions
- Workflow files are properly formatted YAML
- Google Cloud services are enabled
